# Cookiecutter Data Science at UPOD

This is a Cookiecutter template for Data Science projects at UPOD. It is based on the [template by DataDriven](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science/tree/master) (you can see the [original project's homepage here](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)).


## How to use this Cookiecutter template:

1. Create a new environment (for example, using [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)). Make sure that it uses Python >= 3.8 (preferably Python 3.11).
1. Install [Cookiecutter package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0.

   Using `conda`:

   ``` bash
   conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
   ```

   or

   Using `pip`:
   ``` bash
   pip install cookiecutter
   ```
1. Go to the directory where your project will be created and open a command prompt there.
1. Then, type

   ``` bash
   cookiecutter https://github.com/UPOD-datascience/cookiecutter-ds	
   ```
1. Fill in the required questions (pretty straightforward).
1. Start tracking your project with Git (optional, but much recommended)
1. DONE!

#### Bonus!
To easily link all your Python scripts in `./src/` with your notebooks (i.e., make them findable), open a command prompt *in your project's root* and type

``` bash
pip3 install --editable .
```
This way, all your scripts in the `./src` folder will be easily importable as `from src.funct import function`. 
  
## Documentation
`TODO`

> In the future, we want to support documentation using [`MkDocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The main advantage is that it is easy to set up, it supports [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and it looks great.

To further customize the documentation, take a look at the [`Material for MkDocs documentation`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/) (sorry for the redundancy).


## Resulting directory structure
